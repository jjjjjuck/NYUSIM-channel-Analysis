function tau_n = getClusterExcessTimeDelays(mu_tau,rho_mn,minVoidInterval)
% Generate time cluster delays.
%
% Inputs:
%   - mu_tau: mean excess delay in ns
%   - rho_mn: structure of intra-cluster subpath delays in ns
%   - minVoidInterval: minimum inter-cluster void interval, typically set
%   to 25 ns for outdoor environments
% Output:
%   - tau_n: array of time cluster excess delays in ns
