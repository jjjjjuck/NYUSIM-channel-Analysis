function PL_out = getAtmosphericAttenuatedPL(PL_in,attenFactor,TRDistance)
% Generate the path loss in dB that is attenuated by the atmospheric
% factors
%
% Inputs:
%   - PL_in: path loss in dB
%   - attenFactor: atmospheric attenuation factor in dB/m
%   - TRDistance: T-R separation distance in m
% Output:
%   - PL_out: path loss in dB containing the atmospheric attenuation
