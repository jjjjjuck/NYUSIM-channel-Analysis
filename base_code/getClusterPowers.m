% Inputs:
%   - tau_n: array of time cluster excess delays, in ns
%   - Pr_dBm: omnidirectional received power, in dBm
%   - Gamma: time cluster decay constant, in ns
%   - sigmaCluster: per-cluster shadowing, in dB
% Output:
%   - clusterPowers: array of time cluster powers, relative to 1 mW
