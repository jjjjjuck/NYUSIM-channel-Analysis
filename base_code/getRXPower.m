% Generate the omnidirectional received power and path loss
%
% Inputs:
%   - f_str: a string specifying the frequency of interest
%   - n: the frequency-dependent path loss exponent
%   - SF: the shadow factor, in dB
%   - TXPower: the transmit power, typically set to 0 dBm
%   - dist: the T-R separation, in meters
%   - d0: the free space reference distance, typically 1 meter
%   - dynamicRange: the maximum allowable path loss, typically 180 dB in
%   the NYU measurements
% Output:
%   - Pr_dBm: the omnidirectional received power, in dBm
%   - PL: the omnidirectional path loss, in dB
